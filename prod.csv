101,Cicero's method," Create a kind of space in your imagination with reference images. Reference
The image, which is often called the locus, is the image with which the memorized one connects. It should have a clear, constant location in space. For example, a plate on the table is not a reference image because it changes its location, and a wall clock is a reference image because it always hangs there.
One can visualize one's apartment, select several reference images like TV, chandelier, washing machine, and tie words to each of them which one should memorize. For the correct ""arrangement"" of the information it is better to move
clockwise and from top to bottom.
Over time it will be possible to use smaller objects, but at first it is better to be limited to large ones like a closet, table and sofa. The visual images that
should not be repetitive. What else is important: adhere to a certain sequence when mentally moving through a room."
102,Matryoshka,"The images are connected in pairs according to the matryoshka principle, that is, as if inserted one into another. The first image is always much larger than the second and contains
the second image. When the first and second images are connected, the first disappears from consciousness and attention is transferred to the second. It is mentally enlarged and an association is made between the second and third images, and so on. The method is a bit like The Chain"
103,The Shed System,"Compose a phrase, each word in which is in a certain order and has a number of letters corresponding to the number to be memorized. Zero in this system corresponds to a word with 10 or more letters."
104,Start Pomodoro,
105,Progressive muscle relaxation (PMR),"1. You can lie down somewhere relaxing and then take a few deep breaths. 2. Hold and then release each muscle in your body, one at a time. Start with your toes and move up to the crown of your head. 3. Do this slowly and methodically. Don’t forget the muscles of your face."
106,Take a Walk,"Take a Walk (Indoors or Outdoors). Doing something as simple as taking a walk can be a world’s worth of difference in your life. If you’re especially cooped up inside the house or apartment all day long or most of your week, going outside can let you refresh your body and mind. Even just feeling the sunlight can reduce your anxiety and make you calm again. Taking a walk allows you to enjoy a change of scenery and fresh air. This can quickly result in you gaining a different set of mind and lets you brag about getting some small exercise in as well!"
107,Essential Oils,"The first method is inhaling directly from the bottle. The bottle has a dropper and you inhale the essential oil from the surface of the dropper. There is usually enough oil on it. And this is where it's important to keep the right amount of time. Inhaling the essential oil for 3-5 minutes from the vial will provide you with enough oil to get the desired effect. That is, you will get a therapeutic dose of the desired substance. The second way is to inhale oil from an small jug of porous clay, where a few drops of oil are added every few days or so, and from which the oil volatilizes gradually by retaining it in the porous clay. It is usually worn around the neck on a braid or chain. In this case, you inhale the essential oil constantly. From the heat of the body the oil begins to evaporate more intensely."
108,Draw something,"Coloring books are a popular product, so you might want to start with this before using a sketch pad if you want. None of your drawings or paintings need be professional level; draw or paint only what makes you feel good or less stressed."

Pause for 1 second, then extend your legs and return to the starting position. 4) Complete 3 sets of 20 reps. 3. Side planks. 1) Lie on your right side with your left leg and foot stacked on top of your right leg and foot. Prop your upper body up by placing your right forearm on the ground and elbow directly under your shoulder. 2) Contract your core to stiffen your spine and lift your hips and knees off the ground, forming a straight line with your body. 3) Return to start in a controlled manner. Repeat 3 sets of 10–15 reps on one side, then switch."
1010,Dance Like Nobody’s Watching,"Putting on your favorite music while dancing without a care in the world is an effective stress-reliever. You don’t have to be a professional or a kid to enjoy the fun of dancing! Even if you don’t consider yourself a dancer, that’s okay. Even just having a burst of energy and “letting loose” in random movements can take off stress and make you relax."
1011,Relax by visualizing,"When you start to feel anxious, sit in a quiet and comfortable place. Think of your ideal place to relax. While it can be any place in the world, real or imaginary, it should be an image that you find very calming, happy, peaceful, and safe. Make sure it’s easy enough to think about so you can return to it in your mind when you feel anxious in the future. 
 Think of all the small details you’d find if you were there. Think about how the place would smell, feel, and sound. Envision yourself in that place, enjoying it comfortably. 
 Once you have a good picture of your “happy place,” close your eyes and take slow and regular breaths through your nose and out of your mouth. Be aware of your breathing and continue focusing on the place you’ve imagined in your mind until you feel your anxiety lifting. Visit this place in your mind whenever you feel anxious."
